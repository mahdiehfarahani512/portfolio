        <p className='text-[17px] text-[#8f9094]'>Hello, my name is **Mahdieh Farahani**. I chose the computer<br></br> field in vocational high school based on my childhood interest.<br></br> As I became more involved in this field and explored it more professionally,<br></br> my passion grew even stronger, and I decided to pursue <br></br>**front-end development** professionally and learn it in depth.</p>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <p className='text-[17px] text-[#8f9094]'>…and I am currently a **front-end developer**. I am passionate about <br></br>building engaging and creative projects through coding.<br></br> When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading books and try to keep myself up to date <br></br>by watching more programming-related videos on YouTube and continuously improving my skills.
